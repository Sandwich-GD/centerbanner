how to use centerbanner

Basically, if you run the script, with any text you want after it, it will center that text no matter the size of the text, or the terminal.

The thing is, this script uses figlet, so if you wanna use something else, then you have to change the script by yourself.

how it works

it gets the size of your terminal (width and wideness) (is that even a real word???), anyways, yea so it gets the size of your terminal, takes dat, takes the text you wanna put in the middle of your terminal,
and then it uses fancy computer math to know where to put the text, basically, to dumb it down, it takes how long your text is, lets say 6 words,
then it multiplies it by however many to put it into EXACTLY the middle.

Alr i dont wanna type any more so yah.
